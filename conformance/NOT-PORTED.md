# Not ported to conformance

The visible behaviour the conformance suite does not pin as a case, each with why and what stands in for it
(ADR-0036). Rows are the inventory's (`docs/research/rust-port/test-inventory.md`), named by the engine test they
came from. A row listed here is either not expressible from outside a server process yet, or the TypeScript
server diverges from the intended behaviour, in which case the case pins what it can and the entry says what is
left loose.

Each conformance ticket adds a section for its own scope.

## `steward`: the Steward (C18)

Every one of C18's 37 rows is a passing case under `conformance/cases/steward/` (`teaching.test.ts`,
`config.test.ts`, `notices.test.ts`, `answers.test.ts`, on the shared world in `pool.ts`). Every Steward teaching
and Notice is also compared whole, byte for byte, against its text written out in the case. Five of the area's
six gaps are cases there too. One gap is left in part:

- **Two of the Steward answer refusals** (gap entry, `engine/engine.ts:9937-9948` and `:10004`). The cases pin
  "has no pending Interrupt" and "already has an answer queued". Two refusals are not pinned:
  - A Steward answer on a Conversation's merge conflict. It cannot be set up as a pending answer target with
    the Steward on duty in a way that reaches this check rather than an earlier one. Rust unit test: a Steward
    answer whose ticket id is a known Conversation is refused with
    `steward: <id> is a Conversation: the Steward stewards Tickets, never talks`.
  - A Steward resume on a merge-approval. It needs a merge conflict and then a resolver run that resolves it,
    which `notices.test.ts` does build, but only to reach the Notice. Rust unit test: a Steward resume on a
    merge-approval Interrupt is refused with `steward: ticket <id>'s merge-approval takes approve or reject`.

Where the cases reach a row differently from its wording:

- `steward.test.ts:148` (what the Steward is told about) is five cases, one per exclusion, plus the Review one in
  the `steward.test.ts:607` case. A queued answer needs another Attempt in flight, and a pending merge-approval
  stalls the pool, so the seven Interrupts cannot all be pending together from outside.
- `steward.test.ts:179`: "never the word adopt" holds for the Notice's Answers line only. The verify round's own
  Brief, which the Notice quotes, says the operator may adopt a candidate.

Behaviour of the TypeScript server the cases pin as it is today, each worth a look before the port copies it:

- After a Steward resume or Close, the Ticket file keeps the earlier checkpoint's `## Brief` section and the note
  follows it, so a Ticket that then finishes without another checkpoint keeps a stale Brief.
- POST /api/steward/answer with action `adopt` is refused by the route with 400 and no `steward: ` prefix; every
  other Steward refusal is a 409 from the engine with the prefix.
- A second Steward is refused as `steward start: ...` on POST /api/conversations and `enlist: ...` on
  POST /api/enlist.
- An ended Steward's `conversations/<id>.md` ends `# Steward\n\n\n` when it had no opening.
- A Conversation's merge-conflict Interrupt raised while the pool is quiescent reaches the snapshot only at the
  next emit (inference: `raiseInterrupt` changes state without emitting; proposal-32 in the RUST pool fixes it).
  The case waits on the event in the Conversation's log first.
